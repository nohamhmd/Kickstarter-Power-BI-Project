# Kickstarter-Power-BI-Project
## Overview
Imagine having a brilliant idea for a product, but lacking the funds to bring it to life. Kickstarter steps in as a hero. Kickstarteris a corporation based on Brooklyn, New York connecting creative minds with potential customers through crowdfunding. To ensure the success of a project, the entrepreneur establishes a goal, representing the required funding for the product. Upon reaching this target, the entrepreneur secures the funding necessary to start the project's development. 

Kickstarter has made public its data on projects showcased on their platform from 2009 to mid-2018, available on Kaggle's website. In this case study, I aim to outline the overarching narrative unveiled by their data.
